# Advanced State Management with Redux Toolkit

## Description
This project is an advanced implementation of state management using the Redux Toolkit. Building upon basic Redux principles, it demonstrates more complex functionalities and optimizations that the Redux Toolkit provides, suitable for those looking to deepen their Redux expertise.

## Learning Objectives
- **Redux Toolkit**: Learn the advantages and features of the Redux Toolkit.
- **Advanced Redux Concepts**: Implement more complex state management scenarios.
- **Performance Optimization**: Understand how Redux Toolkit optimizes performance and simplifies code.

## Features
- **Enhanced Counter**: A counter with additional features, managed by Redux Toolkit.
- **Slice Concept**: Understand and implement slices for better state organization.
- **Async Thunks**: Use async thunks for handling asynchronous actions.

## Installation
